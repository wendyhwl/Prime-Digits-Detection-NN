## Assignment Description

In this assignment we will use Multi Layer Pertrons to detect handwritten prime digits. But before doing such a difficult task I suggest to try and solve an easier problem with MLP. If you succeed, which I know you will, you can proceed with tackling the challenging problem of detecting handwritten prime digits.
